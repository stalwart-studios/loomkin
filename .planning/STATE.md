# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-07)

**Core value:** Humans can see exactly what agents are doing and saying to each other in real-time, and intervene naturally at any moment — without breaking the autonomous flow.
**Current focus:** Phase 4 — Task Graph & Crash Recovery

## Current Position

Phase: 4 of 10 (Task Graph & Crash Recovery) - COMPLETE
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase (COMPLETE)
Status: Completed 04-03 crash recovery ui wiring
Last activity: 2026-03-08 — Completed 04-03 crash recovery ui wiring (agent card crash states, comms events, signal handlers)

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Monolith extraction in Phase 1 — must precede all new UI features; workspace_live.ex at 4,714 lines is a hard blocker
- [Roadmap]: TeamBroadcaster intermediary in Phase 2 — prevents LiveView mailbox saturation at 10+ concurrent agents
- [Roadmap]: Pause state and permission-pending state are separate typed state machines from Phase 5 onward — cannot be unified
- [Phase 01]: Wrapped palette render in static outer div to satisfy LiveView stateful component single-static-root requirement
- [Phase 01-monolith-extraction]: forwarded sidebar tab events to parent via send(self(), {:sidebar_event, ...}) to preserve workspace_live inspector_mode side effects
- [Phase 01-02]: component-owned state initialized via assign_new/3 in update/2; parent-forwarded events use send(self(), {:composer_event, event, params})
- [Phase 01]: comms_stream nil-guarded in MissionControlPanelComponent to allow render_component testing without a live process
- [Phase 01-05]: kept budget_pct/1 and budget_bar_color/1 in workspace_live since refresh_roster/1 uses them to compute assigns
- [Phase 01-05]: workspace_live at 3968 lines; remaining code is orchestration (signals, cards, activity) not UI rendering
- [Phase 01-06]: assert component DOM markers (message-input, agent-comms) instead of wrapper ids for reliable liveview test assertions
- [Phase 01-06]: kept existing module compilation smoke tests alongside new live mount test for fast regression catching
- [Phase 02-01]: Topics module uses regular functions (no macros/compile-time constants); global_bus_paths excludes system.**
- [Phase 02-01]: Comms.unsubscribe signature changed from (team_id, agent_name) to (subscription_ids) for explicit lifecycle management
- [Phase 02-02]: Batchable signals grouped into 4 categories (streaming, tools, status, activity) for structured batch delivery
- [Phase 02-02]: Critical signal types defined as MapSet constant for O(1) lookup; direct send/2 delivery matching Jido pattern
- [Phase 02-03]: workspace_live uses send(self(), {:signal, sig}) dispatch from batch handler to reuse existing handle_info clauses; subscribe_global_signals and signal_for_workspace? fully removed
- [Phase 02-04]: removed last two direct Loomkin.Signals.subscribe calls from workspace_live; all signal delivery now exclusively through TeamBroadcaster
- [Phase 03-01]: peer messages classified as critical signals for sub-1-second delivery via TeamBroadcaster
- [Phase 03-01]: stream limit: -500 caps comms events DOM to 500 most recent items
- [Phase 03-01]: blue accent for peer_message type distinct from cyan channel_message
- [Phase 03-live-comms-feed]: CommsFeedScroll uses MutationObserver + scrollTop threshold for reliable LiveView stream patch detection
- [Phase 03-live-comms-feed]: Terminated cards use Process.send_after 3s delay before removal to allow fade animation
- [Phase 04-01]: AgentWatcher uses Process.send_after polling (500ms x 5 attempts) for recovery detection rather than registry event hooks
- [Phase 04-01]: Crash count tracked per {team_id, agent_name} key across watcher lifetime for monotonic increment
- [Phase 04-01]: Agent :DOWN handler sets :error on abnormal exits, :idle on normal/shutdown
- [Phase 04]: Used tasks_override/deps_override assigns for component testing without DB queries
- [Phase 04-03]: Reuse card-error class for all crash states (crashed, recovering, permanently_failed)
- [Phase 04-03]: 2-second Process.send_after delay for recovering->idle transition

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- workspace_live.ex at 3,968 lines after Phase 1 extraction (down from 4,714) — further reduction requires extracting signal dispatch (Phase 2 TeamBroadcaster)
- Permission state machine bug identified in CONCERNS.md (pending_permission can be overwritten) — must be fixed in Phase 5 before adding more intervention types
- LLM confidence extraction format for Phase 7 is a design decision not yet made — needs product decision during Phase 7 planning
- Approval gate timeout UX for Phase 6 needs explicit decision: auto-deny vs. escalate — needs product decision during Phase 6 planning
